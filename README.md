## Refactoring of Parser

Implementation of a module (Args) to parse command line arguments.
Without a handy utility, we simply scan the array of strings passed to the main function.

## Module Args
Args is very easy to use.
You just have to create an instance of the Args class by passing the constructor
the input arguments and a format string, then ask this instance for the this instance
the value of the arguments
